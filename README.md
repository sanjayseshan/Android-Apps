# Android-Apps

Some various Android Apps I wrote to do various tasks such as:

<ul>
  <li>
    Pixel Plotter Management - Depends on OpenCV 3 --> takes a picture and uses Java OpenCV for edge detection. The picture is sent to the PHP server on the Pixel Plotter's router.
  </li>
  <li>
    More Coming!
  </li>
</ul>
